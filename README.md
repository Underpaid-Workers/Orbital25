## Features
### User Account Management
In order to allow users to store their captured entries persistently, users will need to have their own accounts.
- Account management is implemented through Supabase Authentication, with Login and Signup functionality. 
- User data, such as display names and entry data will be uniquely tied to each user.

### Captured Species
Adding/Viewing/Deleting Entries
For adding entries, users will:
- Capture the species using the Camera function.
- Have the species be identified by the API, returning its name, description, and some basic facts about it. It will also be tagged with the relevant environment and species type tags. Users will then be able to input additional observations they made during the capture.
- Once the entry is submitted, it will be uploaded to the database and be available for viewing in the inventory screen.
